State what the advantages of Virtual Machines are:
  Virtual machines are fast and easy to make, but also to destroy. 
  They allow multiple operating systems environments to exist simultaneously on the same machine. I've had classes that needed to use Linux, 
  so I had to install install it on a VM.
  I first started using VMs to test sketchy program and viruses. Running them through the VM protects my computer and all of its data.
  I first learned about them through a youtuber who would run famous viruses on his VM to show exactly what would happen to a computer.

State what the advantages of containers are:
  Compared to VMs, containers use a lot less resources by running off of processes instead of RAM and disk space.
  They also do not include operating system images like VMs.
  Containers allow applications to be more rapidly deployed, patched, or scaled which results in greater efficiency.
  Containers have less overhead which allows them to be faster than VMs.

State when you might select physical machines over virtual machines:
  You would choose physical machines when you need the most power and efficiency, in servers for example where it's hardware comes in play. 
  
How the cloud would aid microservices:
  The cloud enables users to access the same files and applications from almost any device, because the computing and storage takes 
  place on servers in a data center, instead of locally on the user device.
  A way the cloud would benefit microservices is that a developer can work and change things on the back end while the user can not see it happening.
  Using the cloud can help development teams work at the same time, either multiple teams working on different parts of a microservice or multiple teams
  working on different microservices for the main entity at the same time. Cloud microservices allow for reliability if a microservice fails, 
  but the main functionality and other services still work.
