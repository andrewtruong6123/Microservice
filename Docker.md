# Microservice
## Partner: Tai Nguyen
### I initially had some trouble installing and running Docker on Windows 10. I had to go to my bios and turn on virtualization for it to actually work.

### Then I had to install the Linux Kernel.

### Once this was all set up, I was finally able to run Docker.

### I ran the command they gave me in my command terminal which started a container and ran the image they provided.

### Finally I went to my localhost on my browser via http://localhost/ and it showed me Docker's image/tutorial page.

## Docker on Windows
### Docker is an application that enables you to build and share containerized applications and microservices. These containers run separate from their environments, but allows applications to share an operating system while maintaining their own executables, code, libraries, etc.
### This lets the containers use the computer's resources which means better performance compared to virtual machines.
